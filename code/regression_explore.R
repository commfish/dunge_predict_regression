# Data is updated twice annually 1) during the first 7 days 
#   of the season (June 15th - June 21st) and 2) after the season is complete (fall)

# All catch values are in pounds unless otherwise noted.

# Current regression uses the following to predict remaining season catch (total season catch - first 7days): 
#     1. Catch in the first 7 days of the current season
#     2. Number of permits fished in the first 7 days of the current season
#     3. The percentage - in the previous year (year-1) - of the first 7 days catch to the total season catch
#

# Should season length be included?
