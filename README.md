# dunge_predict_regression
Predictive regression used in the Southeast Dungeness management plan.  
It is used to determine management action (reductions in season length) from harvest in the first seven days of the current season, permits fishing in the first 7 days, and the previous year's percent of harvest taken in the first 7 days.
 Refer to Regulation 5 ACC 32.146

Exploratory work here to determine if season length - as a variable in the regression - should be added. Season length was reduced in 2013/14 and in 2017/18.
